<h1 align=center>  Age Estimation Using Face Images</h1> 

## 1. Problem Statement
Age estimation is one of the tasks of facial image classification. It can be defined as determination of a person's age or age group from facial images. Facial aging adversely impacts performance of face recognition and face verification and authentication using facial features. This stochastic personalized inevitable process poses dynamic theoretical and practical challenge to the computer vision and pattern recognition community. This task has numerous applications in various fields such as security, health monitoring, customer analytics, and social media.

The goal is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately estimate the age of a person from a given facial image. This involves extracting relevant features from the image and mapping them to a corresponding age. As shown in the above image, the model should assign the age for every facial image.
#### 1.1 Challenges
- Variability in Faces: Human faces vary widely in terms of shape, size, skin color, and facial features. Additionally, external factors such as lighting, pose, and expression can further complicate the task. 

- Aging Process: The aging process is complex and non-linear. Different individuals age differently based on genetic factors, lifestyle, and environmental influences.

- Data Availability: Collecting a large and diverse dataset with accurately labeled ages can be challenging.

- Feature Extraction: Identifying which features are most indicative of age and how to extract them effectively from images is non-trivial.

## 3. The Proposed Method
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the best methods for extracting feature from images. ResNet, short for Residual Network, is a deep learning model architecture based on CNNs introduced by Kaiming He et al. in the paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition". ResNet addresses the problem of training very deep neural networks, which often suffer from issues like vanishing gradients. ResNet comes in various depths, such as ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152, where the number indicates the total number of layers.

## 4. Implementation
This section delves into the practical aspects of the project's implementation.

### 4.1. Dataset
Under this subsection, you'll find information about the dataset used for the Age Estimation With Face Image task. 

We used UTKFace dataset in this work. The UTKFace dataset is a comprehensive and widely used resource for facial recognition and demographic analysis. This dataset is primarily designed for tasks related to age, gender, and race detection in facial images.It contains over 20,000 images of faces, with annotations for age, gender, and ethnicity.

#### Data Composition
- Images: The dataset includes a large variety of face images taken in uncontrolled conditions, capturing a wide range of ages, genders, and ethnicities.
- Annotations: Each image is titled with four types of information seperated with **_** : Age_Gender_Ethnicity_ID.jpg
  
  Age: The age of the person in the image.

  Gender: The gender of the person, labeled as male or female.

  Ethnicity: The ethnicity of the person, categorized into five groups: White, Black, Asian, Indian, and Others.

  ID: The Id is a unique identifier combined with the above three information.
  

The UTKFace dataset is publicly available for academic and research purposes. It can be accessed and downloaded from various resources like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new).

### 4.2. Model

      def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.model = models.resnet50(weights=models.ResNet50_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V2)
        self.model.fc  = nn.Linear(in_features=2048, out_features=1, bias=True)
  
      def forward(self, x):
        output = self.model(x)
        return output

A pre-trained CNN, ResNet50, is used which followed by a fully connected layer with 1 output.
